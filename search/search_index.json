Because of this, someone too smarty for whon we have to congrats a lot, created a project which works as a structure (just like a wireframe) with a lot of features you only have to use. With this project is possible to create whatever kind of web application quickly and it's just awesome! SuitUp is a PHP* OOP** framework which helps you to do what you have to do quickly, it's focused on productivity without forget about security and good practices. * Works on PHP applications based ** OOP - Object-oriented programming where programming projects works with objects concepts. Modules You can write different and separate applications in the same project which will be accessed just changing the base URL. MVC It means, roughly, that you will write PHP and HTML separate and all logic is organized to make a more readable and easy maintainer project Getting Started Let us walk you through our Tutorial project and show you how Suitup can help you Why we keep this project? At the start, we created this project just for personal use, because the usual frameworks wasn't giving us the speed and facility we expected from a framework PHP. We just want to create a web project as quick as possible. So we created SuitUp, a framework which you can create your web project truly fast and everything is really patterned. We are really happy and satisfied with the results we got with SuitUp yet here. Try it you too, awesome web projects with SuitUp PHP Framework! Now in version 2!! Contributors Everyone is welcome to contribute with SuitUp PHP Framework . Just fork it, make your changes as minimal as possible and create a pull request . We ask to create minimal changes because by this way it's easier to merge your request to the project in approve case. Thanks to JetBrains that gave us a free license of PHPStorm to maintain this project and develop with maximum productivity. Made with love by Braghim Sistemas.

For this tutorials we will create the project with some addictional features to make it easy and improve the Suitup super powers. To engage you with that check it out if you need first study some of following features: Composer - Git - Apache - htaccess and optionally MySql - Docker & Docker Compose Github First of all, there are a Skeleton Project created properly to begin new projects in the link bellow, no matter how method of instalation you will choose, the structure will be the same: https://github.com/braghimsistemas/suitup-skeleton You will be able to change directory structure of the project later if you want to, but for this tutorials we will follow the basic structure, making everything easyer. Install There are several ways to create projects with Suitup Framework, you can even create a new project by command line with our Suitup Manager software. Bellow you will find a list with all this possibilities by difficult level: Docker - Very easy Skeleton Project - easy Suitup Manager (command line) - easy From Source (Recommended for beginners) - medium To really understand HOW Suitup works we recommend you to install by From Source method even it taking a bit more time. Docker Docker is a tool created to store containers and it works almost like virtual machines. When you create a project with Docker it's not necessary even to have Apache installed in you machine, even linux is not required, Docker will manage everything for you by a predefined structure described in the docker-compose.yml file. To begin with Docker you need to install it locally following your system requirements. Here you can find all documentation needed to do it . Remember that there are two features that you need to install: Docker and Docker Compose ! Docker is one of the easyest way to init a Suitup project but maybe it's the hardest way to modify it because of the configurations made by docker-compose.yml file. We will assume that you are on linux (GNU system based). Walk to the folder where you want to install the project, maybe you already have Apache and PHP installed, but you don't need to put it on the localhost, actually you can install anywhere when we talk about Docker, of course. Clone the project /* Step 1. */ $ git clone git@github.com:braghimsistemas/suitup-skeleton.git Enter inside the project folder /* Step 2. */ $ cd suitup-skeleton Up the Docker services /* Step 3. */ $ docker-compose up -d After that, you must be able to access localhost:8080 and the project must to be running already, but as you don't downloaded dependencies the following message will be shown. Project dependencies not found, run 'php composer.phar install' We are assuming that you don't have php installed, so let access the Docker apache container and download the composer dependencies from there. Remember that if you already have PHP 7.2+ installed skip to the step 6 and avoid step 7. /* Step 4. */ $ docker exec -it suitup-skeleton /bin/bash Walk into application docker folder /* Step 5. */ $ cd /app Download the composer dependencies /* Step 6. */ $ php composer.phar install Grant access to the vendors folder /* Step 7. */ $ chmod 775 vendor -R Done! After that all you need is to access on your browser: localhost:8080 Skeleton Project Check here to see how to setup a web server first. Clone the project from it's repository on github: $ git clone git@github.com:braghimsistemas/suitup-skeleton.git Walk into folder: $ cd suitup-skeleton/ Install composer dependencies $ php composer.phar install Done! Open on the browser the following address: http://localhost/suitup-skeleton (assuming that you installed directly on the localhost). If it was done with virtual host don't forget to add the line 127.0.0.1 {the new domain} to the /etc/hosts file. Suitup Manager To automate some repetitive tasks we created a command line debian based software that can initialize a new project, create a new controller, \"model\" files, forms, etc... All you gotta do to get it is to download the suitup.deb file from the latest release from here and install it with the command bellow. $ sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/suitup.deb After that you must to be able to run the suitup command from your terminal with the following options: $ suitup install /* Install a brand new project */ $ suitup create module /* create a new module to an existing project */ $ suitup create controller /* create a new controller with its views */ $ suitup create form /* Starts a new form validator */ $ suitup create dbtable /* Create the structure to a database table (Business and Gateway files) */ So run $ suitup install and follow the suggested steps to entirely create a new project, it will ask you to automatically download composer dependencies too. After that you just need to setup the web server and be happy with your brand new project. Ps.: A folder with that name given to the project will be created From Source For beginners, at least with this framework, we highly recommend to create your project by this method so you will understand a bit more how SuitUp works and its mechanics. Start setting up the web server as you wish. We will assume that you are creating a project named cowboys into default localhost. Get into your localhost folder (over linux defaults it is /var/www/html ). As this is the more instructive but the largest way to do, follow this complete tutorial that will lead you on how to create all the files one by one and its contents, letting you know what everything means step by step. That's why this is the best way to begin. Install From Source Tutorial Setup Web Server First of all you will need a web server like apache, nginx or whatever you prefer and PHP version 7.2+. A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients. Dedicated computers and appliances may be referred to as Web servers as well. Reference: WhatIs.com Apache Web Server Install apache web server with apt: $ sudo apt-get install apache2 The mod_rewrite is required to work with friendly URL's routes. $ sudo a2enmod rewrite After enable mod rewrite you shall need to restart the server. $ sudo service apache2 restart It's important that you need to allow override on the virtual host where you will run the application (even in localhost). It will allow to replace in the URL names of directories with needed route names like modules, controllers, actions and parameters too. In few words it means that every request in the http://localhost , no matter what URI, will call the same file: /var/www/html/index.php The example bellow shows how the default virtual host address must looks like with that. $ sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf # Apache Example <VirtualHost *:80> ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost ServerName localhost ServerAlias localhost DocumentRoot /var/www/html <Directory /var/www/html> Options Indexes FollowSymLinks AllowOverride all Order allow,deny Allow from all </Directory> LogLevel error ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined </VirtualHost> That's it. Your apache server is ready to run SuitUp framework.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting-started/#how-to-begin","text":"","title":"How to begin"},{"location":"getting-started/#requirements","text":"Suitup Framework requires PHP >= 7.2 and whatever web server you prefer.
