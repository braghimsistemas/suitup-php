For this tutorials we will create the project with some addictional features to make it easy and improve the Suitup super powers. To engage you with that check it out if you need first study some of following features: Composer - Git - Apache - htaccess and optionally MySql - Docker & Docker Compose Github First of all, there is a Skeleton Project created properly to begin new projects in the link bellow, no matter how method of instalation you will choose, the structure will be the same: https://github.com/braghimsistemas/suitup-skeleton Tip You will be able to change directory structure of the project later if you want to, but for this tutorials we will follow the basic structure, making everything easyer. Install \u00b6 There are several ways to create projects with Suitup Framework, you can even create a new project by command line with our Suitup Manager software. Bellow you will find a list with all this possibilities by difficult level: Docker - Very easy Skeleton Project - easy Suitup Manager (command line) - easy From Source (Recommended for beginners) - medium Important To really understand HOW Suitup works we recommend you to install by From Source method even it taking a bit more time. Docker \u00b6 Docker is a tool created to store containers and it works almost like virtual machines. When you create a project with Docker it's not necessary even to have Apache installed in you machine, even linux is not required, Docker will manage everything for you by a predefined structure described in the docker-compose.yml file. To begin with Docker you need to install it locally following your system requirements. Here you can find all documentation needed to do it . Remember that there are two features that you need to install: Docker and Docker Compose ! Warning Docker is one of the easyest way to init a Suitup project but maybe it's the hardest way to modify it because of the configurations made by docker-compose.yml file. We will assume that you are on linux (GNU system based). Walk to the folder where you want to install the project, maybe you already have Apache and PHP installed, but you don't need to put it on the localhost, actually you can install anywhere when we talk about Docker, of course. Clone the project 1 2 # step 1. $ git clone git@github.com:braghimsistemas/suitup-skeleton.git Enter inside the project folder 1 2 # Step 2. $ cd suitup-skeleton Up the Docker services 1 2 # Step 3. $ docker-compose up -d After that, you must be able to access localhost:8080 and the project must to be running already, but as you don't downloaded dependencies the following message will be shown. Project dependencies not found, run 'php composer.phar install' We are assuming that you don't have php installed, so let access the Docker apache container and download the composer dependencies from there. Remember that if you already have PHP 7.2+ installed skip to the step 6 and avoid step 7. 1 2 # Step 4. $ docker exec -it suitup-skeleton /bin/bash Walk into application docker folder 1 2 # Step 5. $ cd /app Download the composer dependencies 1 2 # Step 6. $ php composer.phar install Grant access to the vendors folder 1 2 #Step 7. $ chmod 775 vendor -R Done! After that all you need is to access on your browser: localhost:8080 Skeleton Project \u00b6 Check here to see how to setup a web server first. Clone the project from it's repository on github: 1 $ git clone git@github.com:braghimsistemas/suitup-skeleton.git Walk into folder: 1 $ cd suitup-skeleton/ Install composer dependencies 1 $ php composer.phar install Done! Open on the browser the following address: http://localhost/suitup-skeleton (assuming that you installed directly on the localhost). If it was done with virtual host don't forget to add the line 127.0.0.1 {the new domain} to the /etc/hosts file. Suitup Manager \u00b6 To automate some repetitive tasks we created a command line debian based software that can initialize a new project, create a new controller, \"model\" files, forms, etc... All you gotta do to get it is to download the suitup.deb file from the latest release from here and install it with the command bellow. 1 $ sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/suitup.deb After that you must to be able to run the suitup command from your terminal with the following options: Tip Use the commands bellow to run automated actions into your project 1 2 3 4 5 $ suitup install /* Install a brand new project */ $ suitup create module /* create a new module to an existing project */ $ suitup create controller /* create a new controller with its views */ $ suitup create form /* Starts a new form validator */ $ suitup create dbtable /* Create the structure to a database table ( Business and Gateway files ) */ So run $ suitup install and follow the suggested steps to entirely create a new project, it will ask you to automatically download composer dependencies too. After that you just need to setup the web server and be happy with your brand new project. Ps.: A folder with that name given to the project will be created From Source \u00b6 For beginners, at least with this framework, we highly recommend to create your project by this method so you will understand a bit more how Suitup works and its mechanics. As this is the more instructive but the largest way to do, follow this complete tutorial that will lead you on how to create all the files one by one and its contents, letting you know what everything means step by step. That's why this is the best way to begin. Install From Source Tutorial Setup Web Server \u00b6 First of all you will need a web server like apache, nginx or whatever you prefer and PHP version 7.2+. What is a WEB SERVER? A Web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to serve the files that form Web pages to users, in response to their requests, which are forwarded by their computers' HTTP clients. Dedicated computers and appliances may be referred to as Web servers as well. Reference: WhatIs.com Apache Web Server \u00b6 Install apache web server with apt: 1 $ sudo apt-get install apache2 The mod_rewrite is required to work with friendly URL's routes. 1 $ sudo a2enmod rewrite After enable mod rewrite you shall need to restart the server. 1 $ sudo service apache2 restart It's important that you need to allow override on the virtual host where you will run the application (even in localhost). It will allow to replace in the URL names of directories with needed route names like modules, controllers, actions and parameters too. In few words it means that every request in the http://localhost , no matter what URI, will call the same file: /var/www/html/index.php The example bellow shows how the default virtual host address must looks like with that. 1 $ sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 # Apache Example <VirtualHost *:80 > ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost ServerName localhost ServerAlias localhost DocumentRoot /var/www/html <Directory /var/www/html > Options Indexes FollowSymLinks AllowOverride all Order allow,deny Allow from all </Directory> LogLevel error ErrorLog ${ APACHE_LOG_DIR } /error.log CustomLog ${ APACHE_LOG_DIR } /access.log combined </VirtualHost> PHP Built-in web server \u00b6 As PHP Built-in web server doesn't allow to configure something like the mod rewrite it's not possible to properly run Suitup with this method. Actually, you can start a built-in web server with PHP itself and Suitup will work, but only for the home page. I know... It's sad... There is some workarounds, but trust me, doesn't worth while... Don't know what is it? Read more here . That's it. Your apache server is ready to run Suitup framework.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"user-guide/getting-started/#how-to-begin","text":"","title":"How to begin"},{"location":"user-guide/getting-started/#requirements","text":"Suitup Framework requires PHP >= 7.2 and whatever web server you prefer.

The view effectively provides the user interface element of the application. It'll render data from the model into a form that is suitable for the user interface.

How we use controllers : \u00b6 We think about a controller as a place specifically designed from your application (class) that realize some kind of job through actions (methods). It controls the data flow received from browser user and the destiny of these data. It's that what transfers data which could be useful in the views . If you aren't habituated with MVC at this point it can seem a little complex and that this whole thing should involve too many logic difficulties, but the truth is that in practice it's very simple. Example: \u00b6 Let's suppose you have in your view a button that when you click over it will reload the same page, but dispatching a message. Controller get this request that can be identified by a lot of ways, but let's suppose it's POST. Controller request the method $this->addMsg(\"I'm a message\", \\SuitUp\\Enum\\MsgType::INFO) . It will add a message to the $layoutMessages variable that can be recovered in the layout 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 <?php // File: ModuleDefault/Controllers/IndexController.php namespace ModuleDefault\\Controllers ; class IndexController extends AbstractController { // This action is executed when you access // http://yoursite.dev/ public function indexAction () { if ( $this -> isPost ()) { $this -> addMsg ( \"I'm a message\" , \\SuitUp\\Enum\\MsgType :: INFO ); } } } Realize that the role of the controller is receive the request made by browser user and respond it according to the need. How to create a Controller \u00b6 For now you already know what is a Controller , let's understand what is the basic structure to create a new one. Define the name you want to give to your new Controller (let's say it will be user ); Don't forget that this name will be used on the URL, in this case http://yoursite.dev/usuario/index or just http://yoursite.dev/usuario ; Without any special characters, the name of the controller must begin with one CAPITAL letter followed by lowercase characters and the namespace Controller at the end; In our example the controller user will be UserController This our controller must be inserted in Controllers folder inside the module choosen. The name of the controller class and file must to be identical, in our case the name of the file will be ModuleDefault/Controllers/UserController.php Below you will see the minimum required content to the controller file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 <?php // File: ModuleDefault/Controllers/UserController.php namespace ModuleDefault\\Controllers ; class UserController extends AbstractController { public function indexAction () { // put your content here // To send content to the view $this -> addViewVar ( array ( 'variableName' => 'The content' )); } } Realize that to send a variable to the view you just need to use the method $this->addViewVar(); . AbstractController \u00b6 You must to realized in the examples above that the controllers usually to inherit from AbstractController class and may thougth this file is supplied by SuitUp framework , but it's no the truth. The truth is that this file must to be made by you inside each module and we sugest it should be made for turn your own life easier. The AbstractController must to exist because with it you can personalize some methods which SuitUp have no done exactally in according as you need for this your project or even for you can add some methods which will be useful and shared with all controllers inside the module and with that making better reusability of your code. Because of this we say that for a good application the AbstractController is required! Even don't being totaly needed that this file must to exist. We already mentioned this above, but maybe while reading this idea could have passed unnoticed, because of that we will say it again: Must to exist one AbstractController for each module in your application . It will prevents edition of methods which have impact in several modules at the same time. The idea is to create on this file methods that will be useful to be used in several locales on your system (at the same module). It will increase the productivity and you will not rewrite the same block of code several times. The minimum structure to create an AbstractController must to be: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <?php // File: ModuleDefault/Controllers/AbstractController.php namespace ModuleDefault\\Controllers ; abstract class AbstractController extends \\SuitUp\\Mvc\\MvcAbstractController { // Add here how many methods God touch in your heart to make your life better. =) } You can open the file MvcAbstractController.php or use the function get_class_methods($this) to see which methods is already implemented in the instance. Before rewrite some method read [[this link|2.1 MvcAbstractController]] to understand the workflow of SuitUp and avoid some headaches. What are views ? \u00b6 Neither only from PHP a site lives, obviously will be needed show contents to the user and it will be made trough HTML (exception WebServices which return only preferably JSON). The SuitUp relates each method from a controller with a file .phtml automaticaly. How it can do that? Each module must to have a folder named views and inside it one folder for each controller which must to contain a file for each controller method. We will explain it a little better. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 modules | ModuleDefault | ModuleAdmin | | Controllers | | | AbstractController.php | | | UserController.php | | views | | | user | | | | index.phtml | | | | edit.phtml | | | layout.phtml .htaccess composer.json index.php Do you remember our controller user ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 <?php // File: ModuleAdmin/Controllers/UserController.php namespace ModuleAdmin\\Controllers ; class UserController extends AbstractController { /** * This method will be accessed by 'http://yoursite.dev/admin/user' */ public function indexAction () { // Your content // Transfer content to the view $this -> addViewVar ( array ( 'yourVariable' => 'The content' )); } /** * This method will be accessed by 'http://seusite.dev/admin/user/edit' */ public function editAction () { // Logic to edit user } } Did you noticed something different? Now the module used is Admin , it make URL change too. Each of these methods is related to one .phtml file that are: ModuleAdmin/views/user/index.phtml ModuleAdmin/views/user/edit.phtml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 <!-- File: ModuleAdmin/views/user/index.phtml --> < div class = \"panel panel-primary\" > < div class = \"panel-heading\" >< i class = \"fa fa-bell\" ></ i > Header </ div > < div class = \"panel-body\" > <!-- Realize that this variable was sent by controller --> <?php echo $yourVariable; ?> </ div > </ div > Realize that is possible inside the view to use $yourVariable that was sent by controller through the method $this->addViewVar(); Maybe you have noticed that this file, even being HTML, does not begin with traditional type, I mean, <!DOCTYPE html> .

When overridden do not need to call parent::indexAction(); . $this->errorAction(); \u00b6 Always that SuitUp found on the way one Exception not treated, it dispatchs to the error window of [[ErrorController|2.2 ErrorController (en)]].

You can create the login to your system direct in the variable $_SESSION as we'll show below. The MvcAbstractController got the attribute $authNsp which works like namespace and allows you to override it to you create a different session for each module from your system. That means that even being just only one system you can sign in with different users in different modules at the same time.

After that is enough follow previous step to save the login data on $_SESSION[parent::$authNsp] . $this->isLogged(); \u00b6 Return true if exists something in the current login namespace and false otherwise. static $this->getLogin($key = null, $default = null)(); \u00b6 1 2 ( string ) $ key ; // The index which you are looking for ( mixed ) $defa ult ; // A default value in case of previous index does not exists If $key parameter was not passed so this method will return all in this namespace session. When $key parameter exists this method will seek for this index return it, but if this index does not exists so this method will return $default value. Something interesting to be noted in this method is that it can be accessed from everywhere, even from the views statically. Sample: 1 <h2>Name: <?php echo \\SuitUp\\Mvc\\MvcAbstractController :: getLogin ( 'name' ); ?> </h2> static $this->updateLoginKey($key, $value); \u00b6 1 2 ( string ) $ key ; // An existing index to update its value ( mixed ) $ value ; // The value Updates an index of the session namespace to the module.

This method add a message to be dispatched separated by type by the system. To capture this message just at the next page just make true third parameter $withRedirect . Sorry, we have to talk about Bootstrap . Nowadays several sites on web are made with Bootstrap and it brings alerts that are colorized boxes to show messages to the users. By default Bootstrap uses 4 colors to this boxes (alert-success, alert-warning, alert-info and alert-danger). Because of this if you open [[this file from SuitUp|https://github.com/braghimsistemas/suitup-php/blob/master/src/Enum/MsgType.php]] you will see exactaly these four types of messages. We really like Bootstrap , it's just awesome! You can create your own types of messages with no problems, but if you will make it we recommand that it's to be done using constants to prevent typewrite mistakes and useless bugs. It's a very good practice. To know how to get these messages from the view and layout [[click here|3.

Como n\u00f3s empregamos os controladores: \u00b6 Na pr\u00e1tica, pensamos em um controlador como um local espec\u00edfico (classe) de seu aplicativo que realiza uma determinada tarefa atrav\u00e9s de a\u00e7\u00f5es (m\u00e9todos). Ele controla o fluxo de dados recebidos pelo usu\u00e1rio do navegador e o destino desses dados. \u00c9 ele inclusive que transfere as informa\u00e7\u00f5es que poder\u00e3o ser utilizadas nas views . Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o est\u00e1 habituado com MVC a princ\u00edpio pode parecer um pouco complexo e que isso tudo envolve muitas dificuldades l\u00f3gicas, mas a verdade \u00e9 que na pr\u00e1tica acaba sendo bem simples. Exemplo: \u00b6 Vamos supor que voc\u00ea tenha em sua view um bot\u00e3o onde ao clicar ele recarrega a mesma p\u00e1gina, mas disparando uma mensagem. O controlador pega esta requisi\u00e7\u00e3o que pode ser identificada de v\u00e1rios m\u00e9todos, mas vamos tratar aqui como POST. O controlador chama o m\u00e9todo $this->addMsg(\"Eu sou uma mensagem\", \\SuitUp\\Enum\\MsgType::INFO) que vai adicionar a mensagem \u00e0 vari\u00e1vel $layoutMessages que pode ser recuperada no layout. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 <?php // Arquivo: ModuleDefault/Controllers/IndexController.php namespace ModuleDefault\\Controllers ; class IndexController extends AbstractController { // Esta a\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e1 executada ao acessar // http://seusite.dev/ public function indexAction () { if ( $this -> isPost ()) { $this -> addMsg ( \"Eu sou uma mensagem\" , \\SuitUp\\Enum\\MsgType :: INFO ); } } } Perceba que o papel do controlador \u00e9 receber a requisi\u00e7\u00e3o feita pelo usu\u00e1rio e responder a ela de acordo com a necessidade. Como criar um controlador \u00b6 Agora que voc\u00ea j\u00e1 sabe o que \u00e9 um Controlador vamos entender qual a estrutura b\u00e1sica para criar um novo. Defina o nome que quer dar ao seu Controlador (vamos dizer que seja usu\u00e1rio ); N\u00e3o esque\u00e7a que este nome ser\u00e1 usado na URL, neste caso http://seusite.dev/usuario/index ou simplesmente http://seusite.dev/usuario Sem acentos ou espa\u00e7os em branco, o nome do controlador deve iniciar com letra mai\u00fascula seguido de min\u00fasculas; Neste nosso exemplo o controlador usu\u00e1rio ficar\u00e1 UsuarioController ; Este nosso controlador dever\u00e1 ficar dentro da pasta Controllers do m\u00f3dulo escolhido; O nome da classe e do arquivo devem ser iguais, neste nosso caso, ModuleDefault/Controllers/UsuarioController.php O arquivo dever\u00e1 ter o seguinte conte\u00fado m\u00ednimo : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 <?php // Arquivo: ModuleDefault/Controllers/UsuarioController.php namespace ModuleDefault\\Controllers ; class UsuarioController extends AbstractController { public function indexAction () { // Seu conte\u00fado aqui // Para transferir um conte\u00fado para a view $this -> addViewVar ( array ( 'nomeDaVariavel' => 'Seu conte\u00fado' )); } } Note que para transferir uma vari\u00e1vel para a view basta voc\u00ea utilizar o m\u00e9todo $this->addViewVar(); . AbstractController \u00b6 Voc\u00ea deve ter notado nos exemplos acima que os controladores costumam herdar de AbstractController e talvez pense que este arquivo \u00e9 fornecido por nosso framework , mas isso n\u00e3o \u00e9 verdade. A verdade \u00e9 que este arquivo dever\u00e1 ser criado por voc\u00ea dentro de cada m\u00f3dulo e n\u00f3s sugerimos que isso seja feito para facilitar sua vida. O AbstractController deve existir para que voc\u00ea possa personalizar alguns m\u00e9todos que o SuitUp n\u00e3o implementou exatamente de acordo com o que voc\u00ea precisa para este projeto ou at\u00e9 mesmo para adicionar m\u00e9todos que poder\u00e3o ser compartilhados entre todos os controladores do m\u00f3dulo e assim melhorar a reusabilidade do seu c\u00f3digo. Por isso dizemos que para uma boa aplica\u00e7\u00e3o o AbstractController \u00e9 obrigat\u00f3rio! Mesmo que n\u00e3o seja de fato obrigat\u00f3rio que este arquivo exista. N\u00f3s j\u00e1 mencionamos isso acima, mas talvez durante a leitura este bloco lhe tenha passado sem muita import\u00e2ncia, por isso vamos frisar novamente: Deve existir um AbstractController para cada m\u00f3dulo do seu aplicativo . Isso evita edi\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00e9todos que impactam em v\u00e1rios m\u00f3dulos ao mesmo tempo. A ideia \u00e9 criar neste arquivo m\u00e9todos que s\u00e3o \u00fateis para serem usados em diversos locais (do mesmo m\u00f3dulo) de seu sistema para al\u00e9m de aumentar a produtividade tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o ter que reescrever o mesmo bloco de c\u00f3digo v\u00e1rias vezes. A estrutura m\u00ednima de um AbstractController deve ser: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <?php // Arquivo: ModuleDefault/Controllers/AbstractController.php namespace ModuleDefault\\Controllers ; abstract class AbstractController extends \\SuitUp\\Mvc\\MvcAbstractController { // Adicione aqui os m\u00e9todos que ser\u00e3o \u00fateis a voc\u00ea em diversos controladores. } Voc\u00ea pode abrir o arquivo MvcAbstractController.php ou usar a fun\u00e7\u00e3o get_class_methods($this) para ver quais m\u00e9todos j\u00e1 est\u00e3o inclusos na inst\u00e2ncia. Antes de sobrescrever algum m\u00e9todo leia [[este link|2.1 MvcAbstractController]] para entender o workflow do SuitUp e evitar algumas dores de cabe\u00e7a. O que s\u00e3o views ? \u00b6 Nem s\u00f3 de PHP vive um site, obviamente ser\u00e1 necess\u00e1rio mostrar conte\u00fados para o usu\u00e1rio e isso ser\u00e1 feito atrav\u00e9s de HTML (com exce\u00e7\u00e3o aos WebServices que retornam preferencialmente JSON). O SuitUp relaciona cada m\u00e9todo de um controlador a um arquivo .phtml automaticamente. Como ele faz isso? Cada m\u00f3dulo deve ter uma pasta chamada views e dentro dela uma pasta para cada controlador que por sua vez vai conter um arquivo para cada m\u00e9todo do controlador.

Isso significa que mesmo sendo um \u00fanico sistema voc\u00ea pode fazer login com usu\u00e1rios diferentes em v\u00e1rios m\u00f3dulos ao mesmo tempo. Login simples \u00b6 1 2 3 4 5 6 // File: Qualquer controlador // Vamos l\u00e1, isso \u00e9 s\u00f3 um exemplo... $loginData = $this->getPost(); $this->setLogin($loginData); Note que neste caso simplesmente gravamos os dados do usu\u00e1rio diretamente na sess\u00e3o.

Depois disso basta seguir o passo anterior para gravar o login em $this->setLogin($loginData) . $this->isLogged(); \u00b6 Retorna true caso exista alguma coisa no namespace atual de login e false do contr\u00e1rio. static $this->getLogin($key = null, $default = null)(); \u00b6 1 2 ( string ) $ key ; // Um \u00ed ndice para ser buscado ( mixed ) $ default ; // Um valor padr\u00e3o caso o \u00ed ndice n\u00e3o seja encontrado .

Quando existe o par\u00e2metro $key o m\u00e9todo tenta retorna-lo e caso n\u00e3o encontre este \u00edndice ir\u00e1 retornar o valor de $default . Algo interessante de se notar neste m\u00e9todo \u00e9 que ele pode ser acessado estaticamente, ou seja, at\u00e9 mesmo nas views voc\u00ea pode acessa-lo. Exemplo: 1 <h2>Nome: <?php echo \\SuitUp\\Mvc\\MvcAbstractController :: getLogin ( 'name' ); ?> </h2> Mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio . Dentro das views \u00e9 poss\u00edvel usar a vari\u00e1vel $login em vez disso. static $this->updateLoginKey($key, $value); \u00b6 1 2 ( string ) $ key ; // Um indice j\u00e1 existente para alterar ( mixed ) $ value ; // Valor Atualiza um \u00edndice da sess\u00e3o de login para o m\u00f3dulo. Se o \u00edndice n\u00e3o for encontrado o m\u00e9todo n\u00e3o faz nada.

Atualmente a maioria dos sites s\u00e3o constru\u00eddos com a ajuda do Bootstrap e consigo ele traz os alerts que s\u00e3o boxes coloridos feitos com intuito de exibir mensagens aos usu\u00e1rios. Por padr\u00e3o o Bootstrap utiliza 4 tipos de boxes (alert-success, alert-warning, alert-info e alert-danger). Por isso se voc\u00ea abrir [[este arquivo do SuitUp|https://github.com/braghimsistemas/suitup-php/blob/master/src/Enum/MsgType.php]] voc\u00ea ver\u00e1 exatamente estes quatro tipos de mensagens. Voc\u00ea pode criar seus pr\u00f3prios tipos de mensagens sem problemas, mas se for fazer isso n\u00f3s recomendamos que seja feito em forma de constantes para assim evitar erros de digita\u00e7\u00e3o e consequentes bugs desnecess\u00e1rios.

SessionFilter (Sess\u00e3o de Filtros) \u00b6 Voc\u00ea provavelmente j\u00e1 precisou utilizar dados de um formul\u00e1rio para filtrar uma lista de resultados. Para fazer isso voc\u00ea pode utilizar GET que recupera os par\u00e2metros de filtro pela URL ou POST que os esconde e torna o formul\u00e1rio mais seguro. Em primeiro lugar gostamos de frisar que na maioria dos casos utilizar GET \u00e9 sim uma boa op\u00e7\u00e3o pelo fato de que assim os filtros podem ser compartilhados, mas existem casos em que isso pode ser perigoso ou que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o queira deixar a URL feia . Seja como for ao efetuar esses filtros por POST e utilizar pagina\u00e7\u00e3o ao mesmo tempo os dados do filtro ser\u00e3o perdidos ap\u00f3s a primeira p\u00e1gina, para isso temos aqui estes m\u00e9todos abaixo que te ajudam de modo simples a manter os filtros mesmo utilizando pagina\u00e7\u00e3o.

At\u00e9 este momento n\u00f3s inclu\u00edmos no SuitUp somente o banco de dados mais famoso do mundo ( MySql da Oracle ).

Para isso n\u00f3s fizemos [[este manual|5.1 database.config.php]] que ir\u00e1 explicar tudo que voc\u00ea precisa fazer para realizar esta conex\u00e3o. [[Manual para conex\u00e3o com seu banco de dados MySql|5.1 database.config.php]] Estrutura \u00b6 Dentro de cada m\u00f3dulo deve haver uma pasta Model com a seguinte estrutura 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ModuleName | Model | | Gateway | | | User . php | | SqlFiles ( opcional ) | | | user | | | | getById . sql | | UserBusiness . php Os arquivos demonstrados na estrutura acima s\u00e3o representativos, ou seja, servem apenas de exemplos. Business (Regras de Neg\u00f3cio) \u00b6 Esta \u00e9 uma estrutura interessante de projeto que evita problemas como perder ou pular uma regra de neg\u00f3cio, como? Um controlador nunca deve acessar um Gateway , esta \u00e9 a classe que efetiva as consultas no banco de dados. Em vez disso um controlador ou qualquer outro lugar do sistema deve acessar sempre um Business (BO, BusinessObject) que deve retornar resultados do banco de dados, mas aplicando regras de neg\u00f3cio. Para entender melhor, vamos supor que voc\u00ea tenha uma regra de neg\u00f3cio em seu projeto que ao excluir um usu\u00e1rio tamb\u00e9m apaga todos os pedidos feito por ele. Se voc\u00ea acessar o Gateway diretamente para excluir este usu\u00e1rio ele ser\u00e1 exclu\u00eddo e deixar\u00e1 os pedidos sem serem exclu\u00eddos, dessa forma voc\u00ea garante que a regra de neg\u00f3cio ser\u00e1 sempre aplicada. Claro que o programador pode pular esta estrutura se desejar, esta \u00e9 a maneira que n\u00f3s recomendamos. IMPORTANTE: Nunca deixe um Business chamar um m\u00e9todo de outro Gateway que n\u00e3o \u00e9 o dele, isto tamb\u00e9m seria uma quebra de regras de neg\u00f3cio. Business s\u00f3 se comunica com Business Criando um Business (BO) \u00b6 Lembre-se, cada tabela do banco de dados deve ter sua Business e sua Gateway . Para criar a Business de uma tabela basta estend\u00ea-la de \\SuitUp\\Database\\Business\\AbstractBusiness e criar um atributo protected de nome $gateway . Os m\u00e9todos ficam por sua necessidade. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 namespace ModuleName\\Model use \\SuitUp\\Database\\Business\\AbstractBusiness; class UserBusiness extends AbstractBusiness { /** * Atributo obrigat\u00f3rio * @var Gateway\\User */ protected $gateway; /** * EXEMPLO. * Retorna o nome do usu\u00e1rio. * * @param int $userId ID do usu\u00e1rio * @return string */ public function userNameById($userId) { // Note aqui a regra de neg\u00f3cio sendo aplicada. $result = $this->gateway->getUserById($userId); return $result['name']; } } M\u00e9todos padr\u00e3o de Business \u00b6 Todas as Business v\u00eam por padr\u00e3o com os seguintes m\u00e9todos. S\u00e3o a\u00e7\u00f5es muito comuns de serem necess\u00e1rias que n\u00e3o precisam ser reescritas.

S\u00e3o esses m\u00e9todos: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 // Retorna lista com v\u00e1rias linhas do banco de dados (de acordo com a consulta) $this->db->query($query, $params = null, $fetchmode = \\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); // Retorna apenas as colunas indicadas por n\u00famero (come\u00e7ando por 0 [zero]) $this->db->column($query, $params = null); // Retorna apenas a primeira linha do resultado segundo a consulta $this->db->row($query, $params = null, $fetchmode = \\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); // Retorna um \u00fanico resultado sem nem mesmo nome de coluna $this->db->single($query, $params = null); Os m\u00e9todos acima s\u00e3o aqueles que n\u00f3s julgamos que sejam mais necess\u00e1rios e utilizados para o dia-a-dia, mas \u00e9 poss\u00edvel escolher o \\PDO::FETCH_* necess\u00e1rio que o PHP disponibiliza aqui . Neste caso utilize da seguinte forma: 1 $this->db->query($query, $params = null, $fetchmode = \\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC); Arquivos SQL \u00b6 Recomendado para consultas simples \u00b6 Para montar a consulta por meio de arquivo SQL voc\u00ea deve simplesmente seguir as regras SQL para a instru\u00e7\u00e3o desejada, n\u00f3s pegamos o conte\u00fado deste arquivo, substitu\u00edmos os valores e rodamos ela no banco de dados exatamente como voc\u00ea a montou. O que complica \u00e9 que quando voc\u00ea precisar adicionar instru\u00e7\u00f5es condicionalmente como filtros fica muito dif\u00edcil fazer isso simplesmente com SQL e sem programa\u00e7\u00e3o, por isso indicamos este m\u00e9todo de arquivos .sql apenas para consultas simples. Os par\u00e2metros da consulta devem ser precedidos do : 1 SELECT * FROM user u WHERE u . pk_user = : user Transa\u00e7\u00f5es \u00b6 A qualquer momento voc\u00ea pode iniciar uma transa\u00e7\u00e3o no banco de dados. As transa\u00e7\u00f5es fazem com que as a\u00e7\u00f5es realizadas no escopo depois de begin s\u00f3 tenham efeito ap\u00f3s um commit , ou seja, se houver um rollBack nada ser\u00e1 alterado no banco. \u00c9 uma forma de garantir a persist\u00eancia dos dados e n\u00e3o realizar a\u00e7\u00f5es pela metade, causando assim inconsist\u00eancia nos dados do banco.
