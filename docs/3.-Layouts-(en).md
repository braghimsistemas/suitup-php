## Don't repeat yourself

Each module need a file inside the views to be the default HTML for all actions, we mean, all `.phtml` scripts will be rendered inside this file. It's called `layout` because it contain all HTML parts which are repeated in all pages from your system. Is not necessary to do any `include` or `require` to include this file, _SuitUp_ do it for you automatically.

> Where you include on your layout HTML the variable `<?php echo $content; ?>` is where will be rendered (printed) the content from _view_.

### The layout

`File: ModuleDefault/views/layout.phtml`
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

        <!-- ... -->
    </head>
    <body>

        <nav></nav>
        <div class="sidebar"></div>
        <div class="content">

            <!-- Here the content will be rendered (printed) -->
            <?php echo $content; ?>
        </div>

        <!-- Query SQL monitoring -->
        <?php echo $queryLog; ?>
    </body>
</html>
```

If you enabled the 'SQL monitoring', point in your layout where you want this HTML injection to be printed, generally at the end of the file, but before `</body>` tag.

### Layout messages
Inside any action from any controller you can call the method `$this->addMsg("mensagem", MsgType::SUCCESS, true);` to messages that will be displayed in the layout after a redirect or `$this->addMsg("mensagem", MsgType::SUCCESS);` to messages that will be direct displayed in the layout.

For this work well add these lines below anywhere in your `layout.phtml` file
```html
<!-- System messages -->
<?php foreach ($layoutMessages as $type => $msgs): ?>
    <div class="alert alert-<?php echo $type; ?>">
        <a href="#" class="close">&times;</a>
        <?php foreach ($msgs as $msg): ?>
            <p><i class="fa fa-check"></i> <?php echo $msg; ?></p>
        <?php endforeach; ?>
    </div>
<?php endforeach; ?>

```
