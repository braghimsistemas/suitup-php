## SuitUp - PHP Framework

### Install by `composer`
`composer require braghim-sistemas/suitup-php`

### Project structure
This is the recommended structure to the project, remember that inside of each module folder must exist these following folders `Controllers`, `Views` and `Models` which must to follow this structure, `Form` structure is optional. You can store your *assets* (resources) where God touch in your heart, I use to put it in the project root in a folder named `assets`.

**By default the first module must to be always named `ModuleDefault`.**

    assets
    |  example.jpg
    config
    |  database.config.php
    modules
    |  ModuleDefault
    |  |  Controllers
    |  |  |  IndexController.php
    |  |  |  ErrorController.php
    |  |  Form

    |  ModuleAdmin
    .htaccess

### .htaccess
Our framework only works with `mod rewrite` enabled in Apache.

```properties
RewriteEngine on

# The following rule tells Apache that if the requested filename
# exists, simply serve it.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -l [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^.*$ - [NC,L]
# The following rewrites all other queries to index.php. The 
# condition ensures that if you are using Apache aliases to do
# mass virtual hosting, the base path will be prepended to 
# allow proper resolution of the index.php file; it will work
# in non-aliased environments as well, providing a safe, one-size 
# fits all solution.
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI}::$1 ^(/.+)(.+)::\2$
RewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=BASE:%1]
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ %{ENV:BASE}index.php [NC,L]

```

### index.php
This is the main file from the system, every execution in our project will pass by here first.

```php
<?php
session_start();

// Sao Paulo Timezone (Brazil - Choose yours)
date_default_timezone_set('America/Sao_Paulo');

// Constants configs setted in VirtualHost (we will get there)
define('DEVELOPMENT', (bool) getenv("DEVELOPMENT"));
define('SHOW_ERRORS', (bool) getenv("SHOW_ERRORS"));
if (SHOW_ERRORS) {
	error_reporting(E_ALL);
	ini_set('display_errors', true);
}

// Root path
// Everything is related to the root path
chdir(__DIR__);

// Simple functions defined by you as help (optional)
// include_once './functions.php';

// Setup autoloading composer
if (file_exists('vendor/autoload.php')) {
	$loader = include 'vendor/autoload.php';
	
	// If you want, can add your libraries here with composer
	// $loader->add('System', 'library/.');
} else {
	exit("Project dependencies not found, execute 'php composer.phar install' in the root of project");
}

// To run our framework, we actually must to run just this few lines below
$mvc = new SuitUpStart('relative/path/to/your/modules/');

// If you want, you can monitoring your SQL queries
// just adding this line below
$mvc->setSqlMonitor(DEVELOPMENT);

// Here is where fun begin! \o/
$mvc->run();
```

### Virtual Host
We recommend you to create your own Virtual Host for each application, simulating with that an environment more next to the production application working
```bash
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin youremail@yourhost.com.br

        ServerName yourprojectname.dev
        ServerAlias yourprojectname.dev

        DocumentRoot /var/www/yourProject
        <Directory /var/www/yourProject>
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride All 
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from all 
        </Directory>

        // We don't show these folders created as recommended structure
        // because it just don't mind. You can choose whatever folder to
        // store your log files, feel in home ;)
        ErrorLog /var/www/yourProject/var/log/error.log
        CustomLog /var/www/yourProject/var/log/access.log combined

        LogLevel warn

        # Environment variables
        # Make sure to not include this variables online or even make it always false
        SetEnv DEVELOPMENT true
        SetEnv SHOW_ERRORS true
</VirtualHost>
```

This is everything you must to know to make it works. Good job, thank you!
