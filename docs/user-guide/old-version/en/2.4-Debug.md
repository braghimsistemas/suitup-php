## Checking out the system work
It's really useful can see what some variable is storing while we're developing the system, for that we dispose a simple function (it's really a function, not a method) to show the content from anyone kind of variable.

`dump($var);`

It will print with a good visualization the content of any kind of variable which is passed as parameter.

### This function break the system after **print**
That's right, at the end of this function there's an `exit` to make the system break before display HTML results, it's made to remove all visual distractions. Anyway, you can disable it passing the second parameter `false`.


Example:
```php
    echo dump($var, false);

```
