## Skeleton Project

!!! success ""
    As you are in a hurry just checkout our skeleton project from github and clone into your web server folder,
    install composer dependencies and be happy. It's pretty simple, right? =)

If needed [check here](/user-guide/getting-started/#setup-web-server) to see how to setup a web server first.

Clone the project from it's repository on github:

    $ git clone git@github.com:braghimsistemas/suitup-skeleton.git

Walk into folder:

    $ cd suitup-skeleton/

Install composer dependencies

    $ php composer.phar install

Done!

!!! note
    Open on the browser the following address: `http://localhost/suitup-skeleton`
    (assuming that you installed directly on the localhost).
